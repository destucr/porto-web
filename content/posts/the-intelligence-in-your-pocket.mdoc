excerpt: "On-device AI isn't just about speed or saving money on server costs. It's about building a relationship of trust between the user and their device."

When people talk about AI today, they usually imagine a massive cluster of servers in a data center somewhere, consuming enough electricity to power a small city. We’ve been taught that intelligence is something that happens "out there," in the cloud.

But when you build for iOS, you realize that the most profound intelligence is the kind that stays in your pocket. 

### The Latency of Thought

When I was building "Telly," the sign language learning app, I faced a choice. I could have sent every frame of video to a powerful server. It would have been easier to implement. But every millisecond of latency is a tax on the user’s focus. If the app has to wait for a response from the cloud to tell you if your hand is in the right position, the "flow" of learning is broken.

By using **Core ML** to keep the intelligence on the device, the feedback becomes instant. It stops feeling like a "request and response" and starts feeling like a mirror. This isn't just a technical optimization; it's a pedagogical one. Instant feedback allows the human brain to learn at the speed of thought.

### The Privacy of the Physical

There is also a deeper, more human reason to keep the "brain" local. Some data is too personal to ever leave the device. When an app listens to a baby's heartbeat or watches a user's movements, it is entering a private space. 

As developers, we often treat privacy as a compliance checkbox. But privacy is actually a design constraint that forces better engineering. When you can’t rely on the infinite resources of the cloud, you have to be precise. You have to optimize your models. You have to understand exactly what data you need and why. 

### The Craftsman’s Choice

Choosing the local path is harder. You have to worry about thermal throttling, battery life, and the limited memory of a smartphone. But this is where the real craft of iOS engineering lies. 

It takes an artist to shrink a massive neural network until it fits inside a few megabytes without losing its edge. It takes a product manager with conviction to say "No" to the easy cloud API because they value the user's trust more than a faster shipping date.

In 2025, the "cool" thing is to have the biggest model in the cloud. But I believe the most *impactful* thing is to have the smartest app in the pocket. Because when the intelligence is local, the power belongs to the user, not the server.
