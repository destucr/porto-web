#### Audio Engineering & Visualization
Developed a specialized iOS solution for real-time baby heartbeat monitoring, leveraging advanced audio processing frameworks.

- **Real-time Visualization**: Implemented dynamic waveform rendering using Core Animation to provide visual feedback for audio signals.
- **Audio Filtering**: Utilized AudioKit to refine raw audio input, specifically targeting frequencies relevant to fetal heartbeats while minimizing background noise.
- **End-to-End Experience**: Designed and built the complete user journey, from onboarding to recording and playback flows.
