#### What it does
Transit agencies use the CMS to create and edit routes, stops, and schedules. Commuters use the public viewer to explore
transit maps and timetables in real-time.

#### How I built it
- **Full-Stack Transit Engine**: Built a Go backend with PostgreSQL using GORM to handle complex relational integrity
across agencies, routes, and schedules.
- **Dual-Frontend Architecture**: Created specialized React interfaces—a high-density CMS for operators and a clean
Leaflet-based map viewer for the public.
- **Geospatial Studio**: Built an interactive route editor allowing real-time map-based stop placement and trip pattern
validation.
- **Containerized Orchestration**: Dockerized the entire ecosystem for consistent deployment and scaling.

#### Challenges
The hardest part was designing the CMS interface to display high-density transit data without overwhelming
operators—GTFS files can have thousands of interconnected records, and a single mistake cascades through the entire
system.
