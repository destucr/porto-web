### iOS Developer & Product Manager

> *"Building mobile apps that deliver the message clearly and are built with intentional purpose."*

## 🧭 The Pursuit
I am driven by the challenge of moving beyond standard application development into **system-level engineering**. My focus lies in native iOS depth—specifically where hardware meets software. I pursue mastery in:

*   **Audio Systems:** Refining how we perceive sound through `AVFoundation` and `AudioKit`.
*   **On-Device Intelligence:** Implementing privacy-first, high-performance ML models using `CoreML`.
*   **Spatial Context:** Building accurate, real-time tracking solutions with `MapKit` and `Core Location`.

## 🛠 The Philosophy: Clarity and Intent
I believe every line of code should have a clear reason for being there. My background in **Product Management** helps me ensure that technical choices always support the actual message we want to deliver. I focus on:
*   Respecting the user's intelligence and time.
*   Being intentional with every technical choice (Clean Architecture, SwiftData, CI/CD).
*   Drive measurable impact through data-informed prioritization.

## ⚡ The Desire
I desire to build tools that feel "inevitable"—apps that are so refined and technically sound that they become essential to the user's workflow. I am constantly seeking environments where performance is a feature, not an afterthought, and where cross-functional teams collaborate to solve non-trivial problems.
