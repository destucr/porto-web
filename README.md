## 🧭 The Pursuit
I am driven by the challenge of moving beyond standard application development into **system-level engineering**. My focus lies in native iOS depth—specifically where hardware meets software. I pursue mastery in:

*   **Audio Systems:** Refining how we perceive sound through `AVFoundation` and `AudioKit`.
*   **On-Device Intelligence:** Implementing privacy-first, high-performance ML models using `CoreML`.
*   **Spatial Context:** Building accurate, real-time tracking solutions with `MapKit` and `Core Location`.

## 🛠 The Philosophy: Intentional Engineering
I believe that code without a "Why" is just noise. My background in **Product Management** allows me to treat every technical decision as a product decision. I don't just build features; I architect solutions that:
*   Respect the user's intelligence and time.
*   Prioritize technical rigor (Clean Architecture, SwiftData, CI/CD).
*   Drive measurable impact through data-informed prioritization.

## ⚡ The Desire
I desire to build tools that feel "inevitable"—apps that are so refined and technically sound that they become essential to the user's workflow. I am constantly seeking environments where performance is a feature, not an afterthought, and where cross-functional teams collaborate to solve non-trivial problems.
